/*
 * Jacobi Point Iteration is an iterative method for solving the system Ax = y. It works by splitting the matrix A into
 * matrices D (diagonal), L (lower triangular with zero diagonal), and U (upper triangular with zero diagonal), such
 * that A = D + L + U. The equation is then expressed as x_(n+1) = D^{-1} (y - (L + U)x_(n)). This means that all the
 * functions in this file require that the diagonals of the matrices are non-zero.
